#boolean is one of the data type that represents one of two values either true or false:

number = 10
print(number<15) #True
print(number>100) # False

Comparison Operators:

<          Less than
>          Greater than
==         Equal   
!=         Not equal
>=         Greater than or equal to
<=         Less than or equal to



number = 10
# equal to
print(number == 10) # True

number = 10.0
# comparing float and integer
print(number == 10) # True

number = '10'
# comparing string and integer
print(number == 10) # False

number = '10'
# not equal to
print(number != 10) # True

number = 10
# less than or equal to
print(number <= 10) # True

number = 10
# greater than or equal to
print(number >= 10) # True

#Logical Operators
Python also has three logical operators that operate on the boolean values. Here's a list of the logical operators.


Logical Operators:

and         True if both operands are True
or          True if either of the operands is True
not         True if the operand is False

age = 30
percentage = 70.5

result = age>=20 and percentage>=80
print(result)#False
True
True

age = 30
percentage = 70.5

result = age>=20 and percentage>=60
print(result)#True


age = 30
percentage = 70.5

result = age>=20 or percentage>=90
print(result)#True
